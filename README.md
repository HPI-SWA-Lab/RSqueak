A bunch of scripts for benchmarking
[RSqueak](https://github.com/HPI-SWA-Lab/RSqueak) vs
[Cog/Spur](http://www.mirandabanda.org/files/Cog/VM/latest/) and posting the
results to our
[Codespeed](https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/codespeed/). Very specific
to RSqueak. Probably not useful for re-use.
